FOLDERS MEANING
	h: To store all the other pages folders in order to keep organization.
	s: Stands for "shortener". It contains pages that work as shorteners. I can also change the url destiny as I wish.

DEFAULT VALUES
	header default color: #bd0058

Header
	The header inside all the pages is static but the one at home page.

Changes 2020/05/28
	I decided to put all folders/routers at the project root so that all the pages will have
	the structure justvice.github.io/page instead of justvice.github.io/h/page
